## Motivation

Taking my knowledge of neural network and artificial intelligence
and designing a more versatile and generic neural network is something
I have always wanted to do. I have decided this summer to finally set
things in motion using C++.

## TODOs

### Design Decisions

What things are going to be classes? Structs? Simple functions?

What inline functions can I use to optimize certain calculations?

Should I use the [linear algebra library from Facial Recognition](https://github.com/minpark815/Facial-Recognition/blob/master/src/libs/linalg.h)?
